## JUDICIARY INFORMATION SYSTEM

# Overview

The Judicial Information System Software (JISS) is a program to be used by the judges, lawyers and 
registrars to improve the efficiency in handling the court cases. 

	- 	JISS makes cases easy to handle for the registrars by making it easy to assign dates to each case, 	
		search for pending cases on a given date etc, rather than going through a lot of physical documents to do the same.
		
	- 	System also provides information related to the cases which have been resolved so that the judges 
		can refer to them to improve their judgements and so that the lawyers can develop their line of arguments. 
		
	- 	JISS aims to improve the case handling system of courts by replacing physical documents and papers,
		which can sometimes be tedious to handle.
